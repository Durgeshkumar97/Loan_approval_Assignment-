# AUTOMATE BUSINESS LOAN APPROVAL SYSTEM This project aimed to automate the loan approval system for business loans by studying insights from data and using different metrics such as loans defaulted. The project used SQL and explored the dataset by utilizing window functions and case functions to derive insights. The project did not rely on machine learning algorithms but rather used SQL queries to manipulate and analyze the data. The insights gained from the project could help automate the loan approval system and provide valuable information to loan officers for better decision-making. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of SQL in providing insights and automating complex business processes.
